        <div>Environmental Responsibility</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>Made in Cleveland, Ohio USA since 1921. Vitamix uses domestic and global sourcing with a commitment to reducing environmental impact. Our factory is designed for efficiency with waste reduction programs in place.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>All containers are BPA-free Tritan copolyester. We use recyclable packaging materials and have eliminated unnecessary plastic wrap. No harmful plasticizers or phthalates in any components.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>Vitamix blenders are built to last 10-20+ years with proper care. This longevity means fewer blenders in landfills compared to replacing cheap models every 2-3 years.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>Blade assemblies and other parts can be replaced individually rather than discarding the entire unit. We offer repair services to extend product life even further.</div>
      </div>
